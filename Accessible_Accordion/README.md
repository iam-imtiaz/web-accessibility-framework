An <b>accordion</b> in web design is a UI (User Interface) component that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It's often used to display information in a space-efficient way, where only the headers or titles are visible initially, and users can click on them to reveal more content.

Accordion Header/Button: Each header/button controls the visibility of its associated panel. Use the following WAI-ARIA properties:
<ul>
<li><code>role="button"</code> is implicit in the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li><code>aria-expanded</code>: Indicates whether the content associated with the button is expanded (true) or collapsed (false).</li>
<li><code>aria-controls</code>: Points to the id of the associated content panel.</li>
<li><code>role="region"</code>: Identifies the panel as a live region, making it easier for screen readers to announce its content when expanded.</li>
<li><code>aria-labelledby</code>: Points to the id of the button that controls this panel, establishing a relationship between the button and the panel.</li>
<li><code>hidden</code>: When the panel is collapsed, use the <code>hidden</code> attribute or CSS (e.g., <code>display: none</code>) to hide it from both view and assistive technology.</li>
</ul>
