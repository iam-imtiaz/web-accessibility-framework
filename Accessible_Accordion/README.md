An <b>accordion</b> in web design is a UI (User Interface) component that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It's often used to display information in a space-efficient way, where only the headers or titles are visible initially, and users can click on them to reveal more content.

<br>Accordion Header/Button
Each header/button controls the visibility of its associated panel. 
<br>Use the following WAI-ARIA properties:
<ul>
<li>role="button" is implicit in the <button> element.
<li>aria-expanded: Indicates whether the content associated with the button is expanded (true) or collapsed (false).
<li>aria-controls: Points to the id of the associated content panel.
<li>role="region": Identifies the panel as a live region, making it easier for screen readers to announce its content when expanded.
<li>aria-labelledby: Points to the id of the button that controls this panel, establishing a relationship between the button and the panel.
<br>hidden: When the panel is collapsed, use the hidden attribute or CSS (e.g., display: none) to hide it from both view and assistive technology.</ul><br><br></p>
